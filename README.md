# E03b-JSON
Here is what I changed from the original file:

 - Changed the exit in FORE3 from UP to DOWN
 - Added a desc in MGRAT: "If you stay here much longer, you will be eaten by a Grue"
 - In MIRR2, added a new exit, "NORTH" with a target of MIRR1
 - In BATS, added a description: "This is a cave full of bats. They are currently sleeping"
 - In MINE7, added a new item, a "SIGN" with a description that reads "A sign is here that points down". You don't need to add a "TAKE" key/value.
 - IN FCHMP, MRDE, MRDW, MRGE, MRGW, and PCELL added a description: "You are stuck with no way out!"
 - Added new exit in BKENT called "ROB" with a target of "BKVAU"
 - In EGYPT, added a new item, a "MUMMY" with a description that reads "An ancient Egyptian mummy is sprawled on the floor". If the player tries to "TAKE" it, the response is "You stuff the mummy in to your sack".
 - In DEAD7, changed the description to "You have reached a dead end"
 - In CP changed the name to "Just a room (not at all suspicious)"
